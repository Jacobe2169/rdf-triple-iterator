# Rdf Triple File Iterator
Python iterator for reading file with rdf triple data.

I wanted to read a rdf (with N-Triple format) without loading everything and stuff like querying the ontology, ...
Just Read the triple one per one !!

For now, I just make a small program which just split and organise the data. But soon, I wish to add some parsing the data from the object part (XML format and stuff like that)
